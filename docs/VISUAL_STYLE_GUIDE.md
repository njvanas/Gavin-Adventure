- Environment lighting: Directional consistency
- Dynamic elements: Subtle glow effects
- Atmospheric effects: Color temperature shifts
```

### Color Theory Application
```
Primary Relationships:
- Warm colors for positive elements
- Cool colors for challenges/hazards
- High contrast for important elements
- Consistent saturation levels

Accessibility Considerations:
- Colorblind-friendly palettes
- Sufficient contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Alternative visual indicators
- Customizable color options
```
